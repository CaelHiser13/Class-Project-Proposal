<h2>Post project</h2>
<p>It was originally planned to have a countdown timer that goes off on new years with fireworks when it goes off.</p>
<p>I ended up adding a background of new york, with my timer that counts down and says happy new years when it goes off, I was not able to code fireworks to go off.</p>
<p>My next features would be a live view of new york, and the fireworks that would go off after the timer hits 0.</p>
